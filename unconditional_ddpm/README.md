# DDPM model to generate large scale cosmological structures



This project simulates the impact of changes in cosmological parameters on the cosmic web using the Quijote simulations. The Quijote simulations are a suite of more than 82,000 full N-body simulations designed to:
- Quantify the information content on cosmological observables
- Provide sufficient statistics to train machine learning algorithms

## Data
The data used in this project is based on the Quijote simulations. Please ensure you have the appropriate permissions to use and distribute the data.

## Metric


Acheived an FID score of 317, which is pretty bad! 

## Acknowledgments
The Quijote simulations are a collaborative effort to quantify the impact of cosmological parameters. This project utilizes these simulations to demonstrate the changes in the cosmic web due to varying parameters.
